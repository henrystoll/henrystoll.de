# Henry Stoll ‚Äì Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website showcasing my CV and experience. It might not always be up-to-date.

## üîç Overview

The site is a minimalist, mobile-responsive, single-page CV built using plain HTML and styled with [Pico.css](https://picocss.com).

Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è to be fast, elegant, and distraction-free.

## Print / PDF

The site includes a condensed print layout. To create a PDF-ready CV:

- Open the page in a browser.
- Press Cmd+P (Mac) or Ctrl+P (Windows/Linux).
- Choose "Save as PDF" or your printer. The page will use a compact print stylesheet that hides interactive UI and shows link URLs in parentheses.

This is intended for quick PDF generation from the live site.
